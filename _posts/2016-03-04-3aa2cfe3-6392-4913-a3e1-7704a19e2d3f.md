## Last Weekend at Skyworks Dec 11, 2015

On Friday, Elliot and Kyle fixed a screen on a drone controller that would no longer work if it were bent or hooked up to a tripod. Friday was a beautiful day (60 degrees in December in Syracuse? Unheard of!), so Elliot and Chase flew their drones on the SU quad to get some aerial photographs.

Elliot and Kyle work to understand why a screen for one of the controllers doesn't work properly.
